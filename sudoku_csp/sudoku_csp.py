       In model_1 you should create a variable for each cell of the
       board, with domain equal to {1-9} if the board has a 0 at that
       position, and domain equal {i} if the board has a fixed number i
       at that cell. 
       
       Model_1 should create BINARY CONSTRAINTS OF NOT-EQUAL between all
       relevant variables (e.g., all pairs of variables in the same
       row), then invoke enforce_gac on those constraints. All of the
       constraints of Model_1 MUST BE binary constraints (i.e.,
       constraints whose scope includes two and only two variables).
       
       The ouput should have the same layout as the input: a list of
       nine lists each representing a row of the board. However, now the
       numbers in the positions of the input list are to be replaced by
       LISTS which are the corresponding cell's pruned domain (current
       domain) AFTER gac has been performed.
       
       For example, if GAC failed to prune any values the output from
       the above input would result in an output would be: NOTE I HAVE
       PADDED OUT ALL OF THE LISTS WITH BLANKS SO THAT THEY LINE UP IN
       TO COLUMNS. Python would not output this list of list in this
       format.
